## CAT RFV Equipment Analytics Script and Power BI Report View
The purpose of the project, is to read and transform raw data in order to provide readable information for a customer. 

The script can handle big datasets (a whole customer), cleaning, transforming and crossing information, to concatenate with a main data model.

Main script / GUI (depends on engine.py): https://github.com/LeandroScovino/EquipmentAnalytics/blob/main/03_SCRIPT/v4.2.py

The main database is modeled to feed a Power BI, Tableau, etc, analysis tool. For testing purposes, I've used Power BI.

Main output: https://github.com/LeandroScovino/EquipmentAnalytics/blob/main/Analytics_Visualiazation.pbix

You can have multiple types/branches of reports. From company executive board to operational managers and site/vessel mechanics. From big numbers, fuel consumption, to next maintenance interval prediction.

Customers can use this "translated" information to avoid downtime, with predictive failure analysis provided by engineers (chart analysis), planning equipment maintenance according to utilization (factory specified maintenance schedule table), fast troubleshooting of equipment fault codes and events, suggest better equipment/vessel operational profile, based in historical information, crossing vessel position with fuel consumption, checking fuel consumption by day, etc.
